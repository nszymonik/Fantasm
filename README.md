# Fantasm

-- BACKGROUND --

This is a game I made for my high school CIT program's senior year capstone project. I lost track of the flashdrive it was on for two years or so, and I hadn't made any backups, so I was afraid I'd lost it forever. But then I packed the drive into my college supplies by accident, and when I went to backup my schoolwork, there it was. So as not to repeat my rookie mistake, I'll create more backups now. Like this repository.

I've replayed Fantasm since rediscovery, and while I'm embarrassed by it, I'm also quite proud of it. I spent about 150 collective hours on the project - 50 hours more than the assignment's minimum time requirement. How many of those hours were used to program the game and how many were spent completing mandatory paperwork, I don't recall. I'd estimate it's at least an 80-20 split in favor of programming. Either way, Fantasm was a substantial part of my life during senior year. Programming it was fun, and playing it was fun.

-- HOW TO PLAY --

The executable file (Fantasm.exe) should be inside of the zip. If it doesn't work, contact me at nicholascoles.a@gmail.com.

-- GAMEPLAY --

You control the little open-eyed laughing-crying emoji. You wield a fan made of touched spaghet and OK hand emojis. (I was very funny back in high school.) Your objective is to reach the end of the level, as marked by black-and-white checkerboard tiles. But the path is swarming with aggressive, nondescript blobs and slightly more descript bosses that want to shoot you dead. Your fan, while largely a melee weapon, can also create a reflective shield that redirects bullets towards the nearest foe. Dodge, reflect, slash, and do whatever it takes to cut through to the end.

There are three levels. I never programmed an ending, so when you beat the third you loop back to the first. If you run out of health, you'll start at the beginning of the level you're on. You have only three hit points, but each time you defeat a wave of regular enemies you return to full health, and each time you defeat a boss phase (each boss has 4 phases, each with different shot patterns) you regain 1 hit point. 

-- CONTROLS --

Arrow keys to move, shift to move faster. Z to swing the fan; this will create the reflective shield if you're at full charge. Space to pause / resume. If you die, click on the big "Try Again" button.

One last thing: apparently, I forgot to list "make a suitable exit button" as one of my project requirements. You'll have to press Alt+F4 to exit the program. Sorry about that.
